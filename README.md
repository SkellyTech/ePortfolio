#  My Computer Science ePortfolio
## CS-499 
### By Kevin Dos Santos

## Overview
  Welcome to my ePortfolio, where I show off my computer science skills and growth in Computer Science through ehanced projects from the following
  - **Software Design & Engineering**
  - **Algorithms & Data Structures**
  - **Databases**

Each artifact has been improved demonstrating the techincal abilities and understanding of some important key areas

## Artifacts

### 1. CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle

**Description:** This artifact has a basic of planning, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. The artifact demonstrates my understanding of the importance of implementation phases through a task.

**Enhancements:** The improvemnets I made were basics of just fixing some of my documents and rereading through making some changes towards it. 
Overall not a lot of change I need towards it since it was amde with another program, but I went through and rereading it.

## 2. IT-365 Operating Environments

**Description:** Is a artifact course that I have done is file management and sorting utility development. The artifact utilizes algorithms and data structures to handle file operations. Such as name, size, sorting different files, date, and search functionality.

**Enhancements:** I went through and updated the java scripts to be more neater and cleaner and readable while the old java scripts were a bit messy at times. Also, going through the documents I wrote for this course and proofread thema dn updated them also.

## 3. CS 320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance

  **Description:** This artifact I choosen is a uniting testing framework. It was designed to test core functionalities of a claculator application including codes of such kinds. Including codes such as Pytest library and which it was the main source. 
  
  **Enhancements:** I made imporvments with the scripts made it more cleaner and readable. Adding new formats of code and new loops with in I feel happy that I have done it.


### Self Assessment
Through these enhanancements i have demonstrated my ability to use algorithms, develop, scalable software, and manage databases effectively. This ePortfolio reflects my growth within these courses and many more I have done for computer science.
